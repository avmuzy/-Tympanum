Project for a simple audiometry application.
In the ascending method, one starts from an inaudible intensity for the individual and increases the pure tone from 10dB to 10dB. When the patient hears, decrease it by 10dB and increase it again in 5dB steps, until the patient can perceive the sound again.
Audiometry starts at the frequency of 1000Hz. After determining the hearing thresholds, the other frequencies must be evaluated, in the following order: 2000Hz, 3000Hz, 4000Hz, 6000Hz, 8000Hz, 1000Hz, 500Hz and 250Hz.
